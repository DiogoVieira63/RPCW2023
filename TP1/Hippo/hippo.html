                            <b>Hippopotamuses</b> are semiaquatic mammals native to sub-Saharan Africa.
                            Hippos are the third-largest living land mammal, after elephants and white rhinos.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although their
                            name comes from the Greek for “river horse”—because of the time they spend in the
                            water—their closest living relatives are whales, dolphins, and pigs.
                        </p>
                        <p>They can’t swim,
                            breathe underwater, or even float—but they have developed a tactic that lets them nap
                            underwater.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These huge herbivores are known for their enormous teeth, aggressive nature, and the
                            myth
                            that they sweat blood. They are one of Africa’s most dangerous
                            animals.

                        <p>
                            There are two species of hippos — the large/common hippo and the smaller relative, the
                            pygmy
                            hippo.

                            The common hippo (also known as the large hippo),
                            found in East Africa, occurs south of the Sahara.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The pygmy hippopotamus are Limited to very restricted ranges in West Africa, it is a
                            shy,
                            solitary forest dweller, and is now endangered.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Hippos are definitely adapted for life in the water and are found living in slow-moving
                            rivers
                            and lakes in Africa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During daylight hours, hippos spend almost all of their time wallowing in shallow water.
                        </p>
                        <p> In the evening, after the hot sun has set, hippos come out of the water for a night of
                            grazing—in
                            fact,
                            this goes on for about six hours!

                            Hippos are herbivores, which means they eat only plants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They eat grasses, sedges, rushes, and aquatic plants.
                            They also eat fruit, bark, and leaves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While hippos like to feed on patches of short grasses (called “hippo lawns”) close to water,
                            they must sometimes travel several miles (kilometers) to find food, making long trips on
                            land to new lakes or rivers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Their ears help them hear the sounds of falling fruit, and their keen
                            sense of smell helps them sniff out the tasty treats. Hippos are mostly inactive unless
                            eating,
                            and this helps them conserve energy.

                            Hippos are a very social species, living in groups of about 20 to 100 individuals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They lead very sedentary lives, resting most of the day and leaving their resting pools at
                            dusk
                            to feed.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Most of their activity is nocturnal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Females are the leaders of the herd, controlling the centers of the resting pools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Males rest along the outer banks of the pools, protecting the females and calves.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            By age 7, males compete for dominance. Dominance is usually displayed with yawning, roaring,
                            dung showering, and jaw clashing.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Dominant males are usually very intolerant of juveniles attempting to challenge them.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Larger males have a tendency to harm or kill the young males during these displays.
